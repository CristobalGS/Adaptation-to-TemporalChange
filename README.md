R scripts for simulations of evolution of adaptation and plasticity to temporal environmental change

Journal article: "Predicting the evolution of adaptation and plasticity from temporal environmental change" Gallegos et al. 2023

bioRxiv preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.12.528221

Workflow

I) Targeted review figures (plot review summaries in Figure 3)

II) Relative effects of environmental change components on the evolution of plasticity and tolerance
	
	IIA) Evolution of environmental tolerance

		1) Function to simulate environments (sim.env)
		2) Function to simulate evolution under each environment (sim.evo)
		3) Function to extract mean breeding value, mean plasticity, and tolerance curves at equilibrium (evo.out)
		4) Function to plot tolerance curve at equilibrium with variation in evolved plasticity (breadth) (plot.tolcurve)
		5) Simulate evolution under baseline scenario and plot outcomes
		6) Simulate evolution under each environmental change scenario and plot outcomes
	
	IIB) Rates of evolutionary adaptation (plot early evolution of mean breading values, plasticities, and their rate of adaptation after fixed shift in optimum with diffences in variability around optimum)
